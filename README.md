A runner that pairs game environments and reinforcement learning agents. Keeps basic stats on the game runs (net reward and end state, per episode). Uses open.ai's gym.

Initial commit includes a basic Q-table Agent and a game environment called "Letter Noose" (aka Hangman). Future commits may include more agents, environments, and more extensive stats-keeping (when interest and free time intersect).
